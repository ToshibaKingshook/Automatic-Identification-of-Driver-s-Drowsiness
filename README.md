The proposed method for detecting drowsiness consists of five stages:
 Converting videos to images,
 Converting RGB images to grayscale,
 Cropping face images using Haar-cascade face detection method.
 Augmented face image acquiring,
 Resizing face images,
 Feature extraction and image classification using ConvNet
